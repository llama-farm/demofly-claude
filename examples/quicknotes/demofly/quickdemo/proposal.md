# Demo Proposal: QuickNotes Quick Demo

**Product:** QuickNotes
**Target Duration:** 60 seconds
**Concept:** Show the full note-taking lifecycle — create a note, view it, edit it, create a second note, search to find the first one, then delete it. Demonstrates all core CRUD features in under a minute.

## Scenes

### Scene 1: Create First Note [target: 20s]
User arrives at the empty app, types a title and body for a new note, and clicks Add Note. The note appears in the sidebar and its detail view is shown.

### Scene 2: Edit the Note [target: 15s]
User clicks Edit on the note, changes the title and body, and saves. The updated content is visible immediately.

### Scene 3: Create Second Note & Search [target: 15s]
User creates a second note, then uses the search bar to filter and find the first note by name.

### Scene 4: Delete & Wrap Up [target: 10s]
User deletes the first note. The sidebar updates. Quick pan of the clean interface as a closing shot.

## Demo Data Requirements
- None — app starts empty, demo creates all data

## Notes
- All interactions are synchronous, so no wait-for-loading needed
